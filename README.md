# Getting-Started-With-Enterprise-JavaBeans
 Throughout this course the student will develop an online bookshop application. Each module adds a piece of functionality that enhances the application and by the end of the course the student will have developed a fully functioning application.  The Scenario:  You have just bean contracted by the Black Forest online bookshop startup and they desperately need the following functionality implemented and it falls to you to do all the work.  They need:  Notification functionality that publishes news about new book releases, special offers and other sitewide news on a regular schedule.  The site lacks a shopping cart, a rather important component for an online business. So, your task is to choose the best way to implement this feature. A bean that performs the basic CRUD functionality required to manage books in the bookshop application.   Once you have completed this functionality you will be well on your way to a fully functioning bookshop application.
